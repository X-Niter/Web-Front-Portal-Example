# Web-Front-Portal-Example
This is quite litterally the name!

It's a simple HTML file which could be used as a "Portal like" webpage designed to create a hub like page to all your other websites, etc. 

You could add more to this and then change the sizing to work for you. 
If you want to use it go ahead! Change the colors, change the font, whatever, it's pretty niffty. 
This is here for archive history reasons, and I'll be using this to implement a later on more complex portal type front page.
